        <h2 className="font-bold my-5 text-lg">Arbitration</h2>

        <p className="mb-5">
          Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to your or our
          intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names,
          trade secrets, copyrights, and patents ("Excluded Disputes"), you
          agree that all disputes between you and us (whether or not such
          dispute involves a third party) with regard to your relationship with
          us, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms, your
          use of the Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be
          resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American
          Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related
          disputes and you and we hereby expressly waive trial by jury. You may
          bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor we will
          participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims
          covered by this agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims
          brought by a private attorney, in a general or representative
          capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account,
          if we are a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision
          will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the
          American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a
          hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the
          case, then either we or you can elect to have the arbitration
          administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation
          Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
          entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of
          applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority
          to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-5">
          You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate, as specified above. If
          you do so, neither you nor we can require the other to participate in
          an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify us in writing
          within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this
          arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out:
        </p>
        <p className="mb-5">
          <a href="mailto:platform@tablane.net">platform@tablane.net</a>
        </p>
        <p className="mb-5">
          You must include your name and residence address, the phone number and
          username that you use for your account, and a clear statement that you
          want to opt out of this arbitration agreement.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-5">
          <br />
          If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on
          behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable,
          then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be
          null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination
          of your relationship with us.
        </p>

        <h2 className="font-bold my-5 text-lg">Time Limitation on Claims</h2>

        <p className="mb-5">
          You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to
          your relationship with us must be filed within one year after such
          claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.
        </p>

        <h2 className="font-bold my-5 text-lg">Governing Law &amp; Venue</h2>

        <p className="mb-5">
          These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
          of the State of California, without giving effect to any principles of
          conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY THE UNITED
          NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS,
          IF OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating
          to the arbitration provision of these Terms, the Excluded Disputes or
          if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any
          dispute you have with us exclusively in a state or federal court
          located in San Diego, CA, and to submit to the personal jurisdiction
          of the courts located in San Diego County for the purpose of
          litigating all such disputes.

        <h2 className="font-bold my-5 text-lg">Termination</h2>

        <p className="mb-5">
          We may terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without notice,
          for any reason.

        <h2 className="font-bold my-5 text-lg">Severability and No Waiver</h2>

        <p className="mb-5">
          If any provision of these Terms is held to be unlawful, void, or for
          any reason unenforceable during arbitration or by a court of competent
          jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these
          Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any
          remaining provisions. Our failure to insist upon or enforce strict
          performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a
          waiver of any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will
          be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or
          any other term or condition.

          void. We may assign these Terms or any rights hereunder without your
          consent and the Terms will inure to the benefit of and be enforceable
          by our successor. Neither the course of conduct between the parties
          nor trade practice will act to modify the Terms. These Terms do not
          confer any third-party beneficiary rights.
