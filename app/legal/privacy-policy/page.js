            identify or contact you. Examples of personally identifiable
            information include your name, IP address, company name, job title,

            card information.

            <b>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</b>

            Non-personally identifiable information is information, any single
            item of which, by itself, cannot be used to identify or contact you,
            including demographic information (such as age, profession, company
            industry, gender, current location, or zip code), IP addresses,
            browser types, domain names, and statistical data involving the use
            of the Tablane Service. Certain non-personally identifiable
            information may be considered a part of your personally identifiable
            information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example,
            combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that
            enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are
            considered non-personally identifiable information when they are
            taken alone or combined only with other non-personally identifiable
            information (for example, your account preferences).
